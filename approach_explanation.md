# Document Intelligence System - Approach Explanation

## Overview

Our Document Intelligence System implements a CPU-only, offline solution for extracting and prioritizing relevant content from PDF document collections based on specific personas and their job-to-be-done. The system is designed to run efficiently within the constraints of ≤1GB model size and ≤60 seconds processing time.

## Methodology

### 1. PDF Processing Pipeline

The system employs a multi-stage approach to document processing:

**Text Extraction**: Uses PyPDF2 for reliable PDF text extraction, organizing content by page numbers to maintain document structure and enable precise section referencing.

**Section Identification**: Implements heuristic-based section detection using pattern matching for headers, titles, and structural elements. This approach identifies logical content boundaries without requiring large language models.

**Content Segmentation**: Breaks documents into semantically meaningful sections that can be independently analyzed and ranked based on relevance criteria.

### 2. Persona-Driven Content Analysis

The core innovation lies in the persona-driven relevance scoring:

**Semantic Similarity**: Utilizes the lightweight all-MiniLM-L6-v2 sentence transformer model (80MB) for semantic understanding between content sections and the persona+task combination.

**Fallback Mechanism**: Implements TF-IDF vectorization as a backup when semantic models are unavailable, ensuring robust operation across different environments.

**Multi-factor Scoring**: Combines semantic similarity with content quality indicators like section length, structural importance, and keyword density.

### 3. Intelligent Ranking and Refinement

The ranking system prioritizes content through:

**Relevance Scoring**: Calculates cosine similarity between section embeddings and persona+task embeddings to identify the most pertinent content.

**Content Refinement**: Applies extractive summarization techniques using sentence scoring based on word frequency and importance to generate concise, actionable insights.

**Quality Filtering**: Ensures extracted sections meet minimum quality thresholds for word count, coherence, and information density.

### 4. Optimization for Constraints

The system is specifically optimized for the challenge requirements:

**CPU-Only Processing**: Uses efficient algorithms and lightweight models that operate without GPU acceleration, with automatic fallback mechanisms.

**Memory Efficiency**: Implements streaming processing and memory-conscious data structures to handle multiple documents within memory constraints.

**Performance Optimization**: Targets sub-60-second processing through parallel text extraction, optimized similarity calculations, and efficient data structures.

**Offline Operation**: All models and dependencies are pre-downloaded and cached, enabling complete offline functionality without internet access.

## Technical Implementation

The modular architecture separates concerns for maintainability and extensibility:

- **PDFProcessor**: Handles text extraction and section identification
- **ContentAnalyzer**: Manages relevance scoring and text refinement  
- **DocumentIntelligenceSystem**: Orchestrates the complete processing pipeline

This approach balances sophistication with practicality, ensuring reliable performance across diverse document types and use cases while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to new personas and domains.
